# Eon-Launcher
This was just eon v1 src

# Theres difference branches wow!
- I've changed some stuff (like made updater local host)
- Some launcher ui has been deleted when i was going to use this for hydro but never did
- Dev mode wont support updater unless you add it
- DO NOT USE HEADLESS (this mode wasnt made proper)
